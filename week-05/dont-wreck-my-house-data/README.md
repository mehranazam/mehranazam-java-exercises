# Don't Wreck My House Plan
## High-level Requirements
User is an accommodation administrator.
- View existing reservations for a host.
- Create reservations for a guest with a host.
- Edit existing reservations.
- Cancel future reservations.
## Reservations
### Data
- **ID**: GUID for reservation.
- **Start Date**: Date when reservation begins.
- **End Date**: Date when reservation ends.
- **Guest Name**: Name of guest holding reservation (Last name, First name).
- **Guest Email**: Email address of guest.

### Validation
- **ID** is required and cannot be blank.
- **Start Date** must take place in the future and come before the end date. Can be edited.
- **End Date** must take place in the future and come after the start date. Can be edited.
- **Guest Name** must not be blank or null.
- **Guest Email** must not be blank or null.
- **Guest** and **Host** must already exist in the "database". **Guest** and **Host** cannot be created.
- The combined values of **Date**, **Guest Name**, and **Guest Email** may not be duplicated.
- Reservation may never overlap existing reservation dates.
- Cannot cancel reservation in the past.
## Technical Requirements
- Must be a Maven project.
- Spring dependency injection configured with either XML or annotations.
- All financial math must use BigDecimal.
- Dates must be LocalDate, never strings.
- All file data must be represented in models in the application.
- Reservation identifiers are unique per host, not unique across the entire application. Effectively, the combination of a reservation identifier and a host identifier is required to uniquely identify a reservation.
- Three layer architecture
- Data stored in a delimited file.
- Repositories should throw a custom exception, never file-specific exceptions.
- Repository and service classes must be fully tested with both negative and positive cases. Do not use your "production" data file to test your repository.

## Steps
1. Create a Maven project.
2. Add jUnit 5, Jupiter, as a Maven dependency and refresh Maven
3. Create packages.
4. Create the `Guest` model.
5. Create the `Host` model.
6. Create the `Location` model.
7. Create the data layer's custom `DataException`
8. Create the `ReservationFileRepository` class.
   All methods should catch IOExceptions and throw `DataException`.
    - add the filePath field and create a constructor to initialize the field
    - generate tests for `ReservationFileRepository`, should be located in `src/test/java/learn/house/data/ReservationFileRepositoryTest`
    - create a `data` directory in the project root. add test, seed, and production data files
    - implement `findAll`, `serialize`, and `deserialize`. these are all private method. may be useful to make `findAll` public temporarily and test it quick.
    - implement `findById`, it uses `findAll`. test it naively (no known-good-state for now)
    - implement `add`
    - improve tests by establishing known-good-state with `@BeforeAll`
    - test `add`
    - implement `edit`
    - test `edit`
    - implement `deleteById`
    - test `deleteById`
9. Extract the `ReservationRepository` interface (IntelliJ: Refactor -> Extract Interface) from `ReservationFileRepository`.
10. Create `ReservationResult`.
11. Create `ReservationService`.
    - add a `ReservationRepository` (interface) field with a corresponding constructor
    - generate tests for `ReservationService`
    - create `ReservationRepositoryTestDouble` to support service testing, this test class implements `ReservationRepository`
    - implement `findById` and test, implement just enough code in `ReservationRepositoryTestDouble` to enable service testing
    - implement `add` and test, requires validation
    - implement `edit` and test, requires validation
    - implement `deleteById` and test
12. Create `View`
    - add `Scanner` field
    - create read* methods: `readString`, `readRequiredString`, `readInt`, `readInt` (with min/max)
13. Create `Controller`
    - add fields for service and view with corresponding constructor
    - add a `run` method
14. Create `App` and the `main` method.
    - instantiate all required objects: repository, service, view, and controller
    - run the controller
15. Work back and forth between controller and view.
    Run early and often. Add `System.out.println`s as breadcrumbs in controller, but don't forget to remove them when development is complete.
    Determine the correct sequence for service calls and view calls. What is the order?
    - implement `chooseOptionFromMenu` and `printHeader` in view
    - use them in the controller's `run`
    - implement `viewById` in controller, complete required view methods: `readSection`, `printReservations`
    - implement `addReservation` in controller, complete required view methods: `makeReservation`, `printResult`
    - implement `editReservation` in controller, complete required view methods: `chooseReservation`, `edit`
    - implement `deleteReservation` in controller, complete required view methods (`deleteReservation` can re-use `chooseReservation`)
## Controller Perspectives
### View Reservations by Section
1. collect section name from the view
2. use the name to fetch Reservations from the service
3. use the view to display Reservations
### Add a Panel
1. collect a complete and new Reservation from the view
2. use the service to add the Reservation and grab its result
3. display the Reservation in the view
### Update a Panel
1. collect id from the view
2. use the name to fetch Reservations from the service
3. display the Reservations in the view and allow the user to choose a Reservation (if no Reservation selected, abort)
4. update Reservation properties (setters) in the view
5. use the service to edit/save the Reservation and grab its result
6. display the result in the view
### Delete a Panel
1. collect id from the view
2. use the id to fetch Reservations from the service
3. display the Reservations in the view and allow the user to choose a Reservation (if no Reservation selected, abort)
4. use the service to delete the Reservation by its identifier
5. display success or failure in the view
